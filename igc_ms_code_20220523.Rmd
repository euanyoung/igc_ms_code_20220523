# Introduction

In this Rmarkdown document contains all the code neccesssary to repeat the analyses from "Lifetime reproductive success is an imprecise but largely unbiased predictor of long-term genetic contribution in humans" (Young et al. in press). 

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
